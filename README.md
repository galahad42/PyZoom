# PyZoom

Python program to automatically join the online zoom classes. The script can be scheduled to run automatically using Windows Task Scheduler.

The x and y coordinates are according to my setup. Get you own coordinates by using the mouse.py file.
Place the mouse at the place you want it to click and without moving the mouse run the mouse.py file to get the points. 
Change them in the PyZoom.py file

###### Future Plans:

* To record the classes(not using zoom recorder)
* Better method to click on the 'Start' href(current method not the best method but workable)
* Show old recording of me as a virtual cam in Zoom
